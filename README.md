# MLH_to_the_moon_and_hack
This repository is to write the progress of creating a project for MLH's To The Moon and Hack!

## STEP 0. Useful Resources

- **First Starter Kit** https://hack.mlh.io/learn/
- **GitHub Kit** https://education.github.com/students?utm_source=mlh
- **Discord** https://discord.com/channels/688852585071116289/688855009634680890
- **Submission Link** https://tothemoonandhack.devpost.com/

## STEP 1. Think Ideas for Space-Related Stuffs

**Remember:**
- **Radar.io:** location-aware projects (ex) a delivery tracker. campus building locator. Find my Friends
- **UiPath Automation:** add automation to the "stuffs"
- **Google Cloud:** can do ML calculations
- **Octocat Competition**

***PLAN1: MANAGEABLE + SOME CHALLENGES***

**1. TRACKING APP: Pace Planet: Study Planner for Space Travellers 행성의 속도를 재다: 스페이스를 여행하는 자들의 모임 (ex) 열품타**

The app allows users to track their studying hours. 
- **Option 1:** Space grows if users study.
- **Option 2:** Obtain new planet if users reach a certain hour of studying
- **Option 3:** Give a special planet, Octocat Planet that looks like Octocat 
- **Option 4:** If the person stays in the same seat (track the space), then rewards with new special planets. (Because you don't really move around when you study.) BUT just in case someone can move around, make sure users to set this setting. Or, simply let users know this is an extra feature to collect a special planet.
- **Option 5:** Send a notification to encourage studying? (Maybe giving too much pressures?) ("God is waiting for you to meet today. Right around the corner." with a symbol of God sitting in a chair with "Hmm...")
- **Option 6:** To advertise COVID-19, allow the planets to wear masks. (customize planets?)
- **Option 7:** Travel the space to meet God. (God comes and says "You did a great job!")
- **Requirements:** Android Studio
- **Benefits:** I already know how to build most features. Can shoot for some challenges (UiPath)
- **Drawbacks:** There is no much challenges.

**8. Mine Space (like myspace) + Idea #1**

When you study, you can Visit the planet to dig the planet to earn points. (when you stay in the same space, you start digging.)
- **Requirements:** ??
- **Benefits**: Sounds fun!
- **Drawback**: As for now, this should be an optional choice due to limited time. 
- **Example**: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.companyname.Space_Program

***PLAN 2: MOST FUN + MANY CHALLENGES + AR***

**5. AR: Face + Planet / Planet Face**

recognize the face and change it to one of planets
- **Requirements:** Unity
- **Benefits:** AR sounds cool. Samll enough to use AR for the first-time. Sounds fun. Use Google Cloud.
- **Drawbacks:** Similar apps already available

**9. AR: Seed the Planet**

Place the seed and it will grow a tree that will bear fruits (planets). You can pick the planets and place them around you. How to seed the planet? You scan your FACE, and you get a seed!
- **Requirements:** Unity
- **Benefits:** Sounds fun! AR sounds cool. Maybe manageable to finish on time. 
- **Drawback:** I have no idea where to start. May not be a safe project to finish.

### Trashed Ideas

**3. VR: virtual reality app with space + find octocat** **WHY?** Not fun

- **Requirements:** Unity, Illustrator
- **Benefits:** It fits for Octocat Competition. VA sounds cool. 
- **Drawbacks:** I have never built a VR app, and I may not finish it on time. I probably need to create a bunch of images using Illustrator, which I need to purchase. The description does not sound fun.

**2. TRACKING APP: Bible + Planet** **WHY?** Not fun 

The app asks the users to do one action based on the quote. Allow the users to check, and the planet grows.
- **Requirements:** Android Studio
- **Benefits:** I already know how to build most features.
- **Drawbacks:** I need Illustrator to draw the growing lighthouse. Sounds no fun. 

**6. Geo-Planet** **WHY?** COVID-19

Find a hint to search for a new planet!
- **Requirements:** Android Studio
- **Benefits:** I know how to use Android Studio, and it sounds fun!
- **Drawbacks:** Due to COVID-19, people should not be encouraged to go outside. So, this project should be accurate enough to search inside of a small house/apartment. However, it is pretty difficult to do it. 

**7. VR: Starry Night** **WHY?** No uniqueness

See stars and planets inside of your house!
- **Requirements:** Unity
- **Benefits:** VA sounds cool. helps people to stay home (help preventing COVID-19)
- **Drawbacks:** Similar apps already available. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.kvasha.startracker&hl=en_US

**4. GAME: Planet Collector / Planet Go** **WHY?** Probably out of time

Collect planets, just like Pokemon Go. Float the planet (플래닛이 둥둥 떠다님). Once in a while (maybe 10 minutes or 30 minutes), Octocat visits you, and it will give you some presents (such as a planet with Special Edition).
- **Requirements:** Unity, Illustrator
- **Benefits:** It fits for Octocat Competition. VA sounds cool. 
- **Drawbacks:** I have never built a VR app, and I may not finish it on time. I probably need to create a bunch of images using Illustrator, which I need to purchase. The description does not sound fun.

## STEP 2. Validate Each Plan

***Plan 2***
- free 3D Models: https://poly.google.com/
- [AR using Android Studio - Model Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JjOeNR7xtU&list=PLsOU6EOcj51cEDYpCLK_bzo4qtjOwDWfW&index=17)
- [AR using Android Studio - Animation on Face, like Snapchat Filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8rakQD4jf4&list=PLsOU6EOcj51cEDYpCLK_bzo4qtjOwDWfW&index=19)
- [AR using Android Studio - Simple AR Game (Popping Ballons)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sy0IKJYG3o&list=PLsOU6EOcj51cEDYpCLK_bzo4qtjOwDWfW&index=22)

- [AR using Android Studio - AR Image Database (Recognize what the image is) at Runtime]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzUpGaE7d0M&list=PLsOU6EOcj51cEDYpCLK_bzo4qtjOwDWfW&index=25)

Overall, it seems feasible to use Android Studio to build AR. It's probably easier because I am familiar with Android Studio. However, for the sake of learning something new, I will now search for building AR using **Unity**!

- [AR using Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTdvxTp9e-4)
I found that the above video's content was used in the previous-awarded app [AR Birthday Fiesta](https://devpost.com/software/augmented-reality-birthday-fiesta). Maybe I should shoot for something else other than AR.
